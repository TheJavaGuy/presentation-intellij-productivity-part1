##  Expand and collapse (1)

- Demo: Open file PRNG.java and find method nextInt(int, int)
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> **Ctrl + NumPad+** to expand, **Ctrl + NumPad-** to collapse
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Downside: on laptop you might not have numeric keypad

note:
    Maybe it's better to demo using XML file
